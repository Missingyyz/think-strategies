  <h2>üß† Think Strategies</h2>
  <p><em>10 Reasoning Strategies for Structured Problem-Solving</em></p>
</p>

## Overview

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through structured thinking processes. Choose from 10 different reasoning strategies:

- **üîÑ Linear** - Flexible thinking with revisions and branches
- **üîó Chain of Thought** - Sequential step-by-step reasoning
- **üéØ React** - Reasoning combined with actions and observations
- **üìã ReWOO** - Plan-execute pattern with parallel tool usage
- **üìù Scratchpad** - Iterative calculations with state tracking
- **‚ùì Self-Ask** - Decompose into sub-questions and answers
- **üîç Self-Consistency** - Multiple reasoning paths to consensus
- **üî≠ Step-Back** - Abstract principles before specific application
- **üå≥ Tree of Thoughts** - Explore and evaluate multiple branches
- **‚öñÔ∏è Trilemma** - Balance three competing objectives through satisficing

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the following files:

- [Executive Summary](./docs/SequentialThinking-ExecutiveSummary.md) - High-level overview of Sequential Thinking
- [Practical Guide](./docs/SequentialThinking-PracticalGuide.md) - Examples and best practices for using the tool
- [Technical Documentation](./docs/SequentialThinking-Documentation.md) - Detailed technical explanation of the architecture
- [Flow Engine Architecture](./docs/SequentialThinking-FlowEngine.md) - In-depth explanation of the flow engine's flexibility and strategy-specific flows
- [Strategy Comparison](./docs/strategy-comparison.md) - Detailed comparison of different thinking strategies
- [Trilemma Strategy Guide](./docs/trilemma-strategy.md) - Guide to using the trilemma strategy for balancing competing objectives

## Features

- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Revise and refine thoughts as understanding deepens
- Branch into alternative paths of reasoning
- Adjust the total number of thoughts dynamically
- Support for unfixed step numbers through cyclic flows
- Strategy-specific flow patterns for different reasoning approaches
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses

## Tools and Resources

### Tool: think-strategies

Facilitates a detailed, step-by-step thinking process for problem-solving and analysis.

**Inputs:**
- `thought` (string): The current thinking step
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed
- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed
- `isRevision` (boolean, optional): Whether this revises previous thinking
- `revisesThought` (integer, optional): Which thought is being reconsidered
- `branchFromThought` (integer, optional): Branching point thought number
- `branchId` (string, optional): Branch identifier
- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean, optional): If more thoughts are needed

### Resource: think-strategies://documentation

Provides detailed documentation for the Sequential Thinking tool, including:
- When to use the tool
- Key features
- Parameter explanations
- Best practices for effective usage

## Usage

The Sequential Thinking tool is designed for:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher) and npm (v6 or higher)
  OR
- Docker

### Quick Start with npx (Easiest)

You can run the server directly using npx without cloning or installing:

```bash
# Run from npm registry (after publishing)
npx think-strategies

# Or run directly from GitHub
npx github:aaronsb/think-strategies
```

### Setup with Node.js

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronsb/think-strategies.git
cd think-strategies
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Make the server executable:
```bash
chmod +x index.js
```

4. Run the server:
```bash
node index.js
```

### Setup with Docker

#### Using Pre-built Image (Recommended)

Pull and run the latest image from GitHub Container Registry:
```bash
docker run --rm -i ghcr.io/aaronsb/think-strategies:latest
```

#### Building Locally

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronsb/think-strategies.git
cd think-strategies
```

2. Build the Docker image:
```bash
./scripts/build-local.sh
```

3. Run the Docker container:
```bash
./scripts/run-local.sh
```

This will run the server with the correct permissions, ensuring that any files created are owned by the current user, not root.

### Development

To contribute to the project:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Add the upstream repository:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/aaronsb/think-strategies.git
```
4. Create a branch for your changes
5. Submit a pull request with your changes

## Configuration

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### Using npx (Recommended)

```json
