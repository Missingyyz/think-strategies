  <h2>üß† Think Strategies</h2>
  <p><em>10 Reasoning Strategies for Structured Problem-Solving</em></p>
</p>

## Overview

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through structured thinking processes. Choose from 10 different reasoning strategies:

- **üîÑ Linear** - Flexible thinking with revisions and branches
- **üîó Chain of Thought** - Sequential step-by-step reasoning
- **üéØ React** - Reasoning combined with actions and observations
- **üìã ReWOO** - Plan-execute pattern with parallel tool usage
- **üìù Scratchpad** - Iterative calculations with state tracking
- **‚ùì Self-Ask** - Decompose into sub-questions and answers
- **üîç Self-Consistency** - Multiple reasoning paths to consensus
- **üî≠ Step-Back** - Abstract principles before specific application
- **üå≥ Tree of Thoughts** - Explore and evaluate multiple branches
- **‚öñÔ∏è Trilemma** - Balance three competing objectives through satisficing

Comprehensive documentation is available in the following files:

- [Executive Summary](./docs/SequentialThinking-ExecutiveSummary.md) - High-level overview of Sequential Thinking

- Adjust the total number of thoughts dynamically
- Support for unfixed step numbers through cyclic flows
- Strategy-specific flow patterns for different reasoning approaches
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses

## Architecture

The think-strategies server uses a **consolidated 3-tool architecture** designed for optimal balance between simplicity and power:

### Core Tools

#### 1. `think-strategies` (Core Thinking)
Facilitates structured problem-solving with prominent strategy selection.

**Parameters (7):**
- `strategy` (string): **Primary choice** - one of 10 reasoning strategies
- `thought` (string): The current thinking step
- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number (uses dual A1|S1 numbering)
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed
- `plannedActions` (array, optional): Plan tool calls for think‚Üíact‚Üíreflect workflow
- `actionResults` (array, optional): Integrate results from executed tools
- `action` (string, optional): Strategy-specific action (for ReAct, ReWOO)
- `observation` (string, optional): Strategy-specific observation
- `finalAnswer` (string, optional): Final result when thinking is complete

#### 2. `think-tools` (Action-Based Utilities)
Consolidated utilities with action-based routing.

**Parameters (6):**
- `action` (string): "connect-server" | "execute-actions" | "server-status" | "create-branch"
- `serverName` (string, optional): MCP server name for connections
- `command` (string, optional): Command to execute
- `args` (array, optional): Command arguments
- `branchId` (string, optional): Branch identifier for branching
- `branchFromThought` (number, optional): Thought number to branch from
- `thought` (string, optional): Context for branching

#### 3. `think-session-manager` (Session Operations)
Manage thinking session persistence and continuity.

**Parameters (3):**
- `action` (string): "list" | "get" | "resume"
- `sessionId` (string, optional): Specific session ID
- `limit` (number, optional): Number of sessions to return (default: 10)

### Key Features

- **Strategy Selection Prominence**: Clear choice among 10 reasoning strategies
- **Think‚ÜíAct‚ÜíReflect Workflow**: Seamless integration with any available tools
- **Dual Numbering System**: Absolute (A1, A2...) and sequence-relative (S1, S2...) tracking
- **True Branching**: Create alternative reasoning paths
- **Session Continuity**: Persistent sessions with resume capability
- **MCP Integration**: Connect to other MCP servers during thinking
- **No Tool Duplication**: Clean separation of concerns across 3 focused tools

### Resources

- **documentation**: Complete tool documentation and usage examples
- **strategy-config**: Configuration for all 10 thinking strategies and their stage flows

## Usage

### When to Use Think-Strategies

The think-strategies server is designed for:
- **Complex Problem-Solving**: Break down multi-step challenges into manageable pieces
- **Strategic Analysis**: Choose the optimal reasoning approach for your specific problem type
- **Iterative Refinement**: Revise and improve your thinking as understanding deepens
- **Alternative Exploration**: Branch into different solution paths and compare approaches
- **Tool Integration**: Combine reasoning with real tool execution (think\u2192act\u2192reflect)
- **Session Continuity**: Resume and build upon previous thinking sessions

### Strategy Selection Guide

- **Linear/Chain of Thought**: Step-by-step reasoning for straightforward problems
- **ReAct**: When you need to gather information or execute actions during reasoning
- **ReWOO**: For parallel tool usage and plan-execute workflows
- **Tree of Thoughts**: When exploring multiple solution branches is valuable
- **Trilemma**: For balancing three competing objectives through satisficing
- **Self-Ask**: Break complex questions into simpler sub-questions
- **Step-Back**: When you need to establish principles before diving into specifics

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher) and npm (v6 or higher)
  OR
- Docker

### Quick Start with npx (Easiest)

You can run the server directly using npx without cloning or installing:

```bash
# Run from npm registry (after publishing)
npx think-strategies

# Or run directly from GitHub
npx github:aaronsb/think-strategies
```

### Setup with Node.js

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronsb/think-strategies.git
cd think-strategies
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Make the server executable:
```bash
chmod +x index.js
```

4. Run the server:
```bash
node index.js
```

### Setup with Docker

#### Using Pre-built Image (Recommended)

Pull and run the latest image from GitHub Container Registry:
```bash
docker run --rm -i ghcr.io/aaronsb/think-strategies:latest
```

#### Building Locally

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronsb/think-strategies.git
cd think-strategies
```

2. Build the Docker image:
```bash
./scripts/build-local.sh
```

3. Run the Docker container:
```bash
./scripts/run-local.sh
