# Sequential Thinking Documentation

## Overview

Sequential Thinking is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a structured framework for breaking down complex problems into manageable steps. It enables dynamic, adaptable thinking that can evolve as understanding deepens, with support for revisions, branching, and flexible adjustment of the thinking process.

## Documentation Set

This documentation set consists of the following files:

| Document | Description | Audience |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| [Executive Summary](./SequentialThinking-ExecutiveSummary.md) | High-level overview of Sequential Thinking | Decision makers, new users |
| [Practical Guide](./SequentialThinking-PracticalGuide.md) | Examples and best practices for using the tool | Practitioners, implementers |
| [Technical Documentation](./SequentialThinking-Documentation.md) | Detailed technical explanation of the architecture and implementation | Developers, integrators |
| [Flow Engine Architecture](./SequentialThinking-FlowEngine.md) | In-depth explanation of the flow engine's flexibility and strategy-specific flows | Developers, advanced users |

- **MCP Integration**: Easy integration with AI systems and other tools

## Quick Start

To get started with Sequential Thinking:

1. Review the [Executive Summary](./SequentialThinking-ExecutiveSummary.md) for a conceptual overview
2. Follow the examples in the [Practical Guide](./SequentialThinking-PracticalGuide.md) to understand usage patterns
3. Implement using the details in the [Technical Documentation](./SequentialThinking-Documentation.md)
4. For advanced understanding of flow patterns, refer to the [Flow Engine Architecture](./SequentialThinking-FlowEngine.md)

## Diagrams

Each document contains Mermaid diagrams that illustrate different aspects of the Sequential Thinking tool:

- **Executive Summary**: Core concepts and simple flow diagrams
- **Practical Guide**: Usage patterns and example scenarios
- **Technical Documentation**: Architecture, data flow, and implementation details
- **Flow Engine Architecture**: Strategy-specific flows, cyclic transitions, and branching mechanisms

## Conclusion
